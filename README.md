# P2P Final Project - Valadilene's Democratic Election System

First of all, you should restore npm packets, by running 
```
npm install
```
after this you can proceed.

In order to run the demo, do the following:

run this command
```
ganache-cli
```
inside a shell window.

In another shell windows, run 
```
truffle migrate
```
then, as the command finishes, run 
```
npm run dev
```
This runs lite-server and provides you with a url you can visit in order to interact with the contract.
